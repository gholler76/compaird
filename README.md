# Welcome to the Compaird App!
## Available NOW on the Google Play Store - [Compaird](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=design.dropout.compaird)

Compaird is a simple app that helps the user perform a pairwise comparison of all the items in a list they supply.

Once the comparisons are made, Compaird will present the overall winner and a sorted version of the list.

## What's a "pairwise comparison"?

It's a method used to determine the correct order of how items should be ranked, based on the user's inputs.
* **Project managers** might use it to prioritize tasks in a work breakdown
* **Developers** might use it to determine which feature should be implemented next
* **Wives** might use it to tell their husbands which item on their honey-do list is most important :)

There are lots of ways a pairwise comparison can be done, with multiple factors and weighted criteria.

Compaird does it a little more simply.

## How does it work?

After the user enters a list of items, Compaird builds a match-up matrix that pits each item against the other.

The user will select who wins each matchup, and can use a slider to determine just how close those items are to each other.

Compaird takes the matchup results and tallies the winner and slider scores to produce an overall winner. *In the event of tie score between items, the item tha won their matchup wins.*

## Plans for the future

I'm keeping the codebase public on GitHub. It's my first real app, and I plan to make modifications and refinements as I go forward. 

Feel free to have a look at the code. Being a relatively new developer, I'm sure there's lots of improvements to be made in the code and overall structure. 

I'm open to any and all feedback. Thanks!
